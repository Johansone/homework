            <p>Dogs are known as "man's best friend" for a reason. If you're here, you likely know all about how great and loving dogs can be, not to mention helpful and adorable. 
            Owning a dog isn't always all fun and games, though. Dogs need to be properly cared for and can have all sorts of health and behavioral issues. Fortunately, because so many people love dogs, many people have experience with dogs that can benefit others.</p>

            <ul style="circle">
